# ML_Summer_School

This repository contains several machine learning projects focused on:

- **Data Visualization**: Visualizing MNIST images using Matplotlib.  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Applying k-means clustering on MNIST data with PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
- **Neural Networks**: Training an `MLPClassifier`, tuning hyperparameters like `learning_rate_init` and `hidden_layer_sizes`.  
- **Statistical & Analytical Techniques**: Evaluating model performance and interpreting clustering results.
